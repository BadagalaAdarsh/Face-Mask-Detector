# Face-Mask-Detector

* This is a neural network based (mobile net) model which classifies faces based on the presence of the mask
* For this more than 3000 images of masked and unmasked people are usedhttps://github.com/BadagalaAdarsh/Face-Mask-Detector/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%20from%202021-06-19%2001-02-12.png
* Here I have used Mobile net because it is light weight which can be trained on the lower end machines by giving reasonably good accuracy
